#Social Channel Programming##IdeaThe idea is to create a site where video's are playing because some where, someone in theworld is trying to watch the same video at the same time. The second part of this idea is to add the video to the channel(explained below) program, where the programs on the channel are controlled by thesocial behavior which will enhance the viewing experience.Apart from a generic site, where you would show some video playing, sometimes we are moreinterested to watch as per our groups interest. Hence channels. Channel provide more streamlined view of the list of videos to be played. For example, consider a channel for comedy, this should play videos from AFV(America's Funniest Videos), Three Stooges, the daily show and things like that. The next step for this is internationalization, where comedy channel would present only as per local users interest.
